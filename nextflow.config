// Definition of clonal groups is a complex process as it estimates that the sequences (one sequence per cell) from a same clonal group should derived from a single germline sequence (germline cell). Here, the following immcantation tool are used:

// CreateGermlines.py of changeo

"first" uses only the first gene listed when a sequence is assigned to multiple genes (e.g., takes IGHV4-30-4*09 when v_call is IGHV4-30-4*09,IGHV4-31*03). "set" constructs clonal groups based on the full set of sequences sharing at least one gene, directly or indirectly (through overlapping gene assignments).

Either "ham", "aa", "hh_s1f", "hh_s5f", "mk_rs1nf", "mk_rs5nf", "m1n_compat", "hs1f_compat". By default, use "ham" for nucleotide Hamming distance and “aa” for amino acid Hamming distance.
